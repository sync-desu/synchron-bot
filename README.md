## **Note from the Developer:**
Hello there. I am sync, the developer of this bot.

SyNchr0n is a bot created just for fun since I had a lot of free time because I tend to be jobless most of the time. There are some requirements and guidelines you must follow before using this source code and you also make sure you go through the [FAQ](https://github.com/sync-desu/synchron-bot/blob/main/README.md#frequently-asked-questions-that-were-never-asked-in-reality "FAQ"). I also expect you to know basic python and you are thorough with discord.py module.

You can hit me up on discord (`឵sync឵#9074`), or you can contact me through any other methods specified [here](https://github.com/sync-desu/synchron-bot/blob/main/README.md#contact "Contact").
